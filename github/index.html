# Git and GitHub
<br>
#### Falk Schuetzenmeister

#### GeoDesign Day 3/24/2016
---
## Agenda

1. Introduction
2. Git
3. GitHub
4. Distributed simulation
---
### Introduction
<br>
- Git and Github are **not** the same
---
<img src="../img/gitlogo.png" style="height:60px;width:auto;">

 - a version control system (VCS) that keeps track of changes to a project
 - a project can be reverted to any (committed) state
 - git works distributed: collaborators can work on the same project at the same time
 - git provides tools to consolidate different versions of a project

---
<img src="../img/githublogo.png" style="height:70px;width:auto;">

- a cloud implementation of Git Server
- a deployment tool
- a tool for collaborative software development
- a project management tool 
- a web host
- a repository for software distribution

https://github.com/
---
<img src="../img/githublogo.png" style="height:70px;width:auto;">

- free personal account allows for 10 open repositories (plus an unlimited number of public *and* secret GIST's)
- we have an organization account with private repositories: https://github.com/tnc-ca-geo
- there is also https://github.com/orgs/thenatureconservancy/, if you want to know what Dan Maijka is up to (http://thenatureconservancy.github.io)
- GitHub allows for unlimited collaborators, <img src="../img/bitbucketlogo.svg" style="height:30px;width:auto;"> in contrast provides free private repos (but limited number of collaborators)

---
### Our Current Situation at TNC
<br>
- Proprietary Software (e.g. ArcGIS) is harder to support (License management, shared servers, binary file formats)
- The consequence, we have to agree on a shared environment since we cannot fully reproduce it
- TIS has not approved the use of Git on TNC servers (but you can ship Git repos as zip files)
- Working with Git on Windows is somewhat less fun (but that might be subjective)
---
#### I hope I can still make the case for the use of Git and GitHub to everyone who write geo-processing scripts.
<br>
- better collaboration and code sharing
- probably someone did already what you wanna do (and it is on GitHub), if not CONTRIBUTE!
- you do not need to be a good coder to make contributions (e.g. language in a documentation from a foreign country)
- if you ask me for support, I would really like to see your code on Github
---
##<img src="../img/gitlogo.png" style="height:60px;width:auto;"><br>(and GitHub as Upstream Repository)
---
### Getting started: Windows
<br>

- Website: https://git-scm.com/
- Download Windows Binary
- Install it on your system
<br><br>

###OSX - In terminal:

```sh
brew install git
```

---

### Our first repo &mdash; (git init)

- Command line (use cmd, no administrator rights required):

```sh
mkdir my_first_project
cd my_first_project
git init
```

(or use Git bash from right click menu)

---
### GUI:

I suggest two changes to your Windows folder view (in general). Go to a folder window &rarr; Organize &rarr; Folder and Search Options &rarr; View:

1. Show hidden files, folders, and drives
2. DISABLE: Hide file extension of known file types

In working directory click right click option Git GUI

<img src="../img/GitGui.png" style="height:200px;width:auto;">

and then choose Create New Repository

---

### Preparing your first commit: Identity

<img src="../img/gitgui2.png" style="height:250px;width:auto;">

Edit &rarr; Options: Set email address and user name, or

```bat
git config --global user.name "[name]"
git config --global user.email "[email]"
```
---
### Preparing your first commit: README.md
<br>

- add a file README.md to project root
- part of the documentation, will be displayed on the GitHub page for project
- uses GitHub flavored markdown https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet


README.md
```md
# This is my first git repo

Text goes here
```
---
### Preparing your first commit: .gitignore
<br>

- add a file that lists glob patterns for files to be ignored and not tracked by git
- e.g. backups, logfiles, binaries, password files, configurations, data

.gitignore
```sh
*.pyc
mysecrets.txt
*.bk
*.gdb
```
---
### Where are we? (git status)

```sh
Initial commit

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        .gitignore
        README.md

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```
---
### Stage Changes

<img src="../img/github_unstaged.png" style="height:350px;width:auto;">

- only files that changed will show up
- use **Stage changed** button to stage for commit
---
### Stage Changes (git add)

```bat
git add README.md
git add .gitignore
 
```

or simply

```bat
git add *
```
---
### Finally Commit (git commit)

```bat
git commit
```

- Text editor will open, add a commit message:
- Commit messages should be short but also describe what changed and identify the version
- ideally within 80 characters
<br>
- commit will be complete when commit message has been saved
---
### Commit options

Automatically git add modified files (new files still need to be added)

```bat
git commit -a 
```

Write commit message directly (careful if your terminal supports history, you might end up commiting incidentally with the same message.)

```bat
git commit -m 'Add an awesome feature'
```

Add changes to an existing commit (careful never do this if the commit is already shared with other branches or upstream, only if nobody else has access to this commit)

```bat
git commit --amend
```
---
### Add code
---
### Structure your repository/project

- projects can have subfolders in whatever depth you want, however git keeps tracks of files (empty folders will not show up in your repo)
- manage files with git commands for a clean git history

Delete files/folder:

```bat
git rm file
git rm -r directory
```

Move files

```bat
git mv filename new_filename
```

There is no *git copy* or *git cp* for that matter since the original file stays in place and will be still tracked.
---
### On to Github

There are two ways:

- If you know you will use GitHub before even starting the project, you can create the basics we just did on GitHub and then clone the resulting repo.
- Still create a repo at GitHub. Since we want to add our existing repo, we need to add the remote repo to our local repo

```bat
git remote add origin https://github.com/tnc-ca-geo/githubtutorial.git
git push -u origin master
```
---
### Git push
<br>

```bat
git push master origin
```

... will push your repo to GitHub
---
### Remarks on Working with Remote Repos
<br>
- always git pull first

```bat
git pull origin master
```

- solve merge conflicts
- then push
---
### A collaboration simulation

1. I will be the Maintainer of the Repo.
2. TASK 1: Make README.md better.
3. TASK 2: Write a module that greats all participants.
4. TASK 3: Integrate this module into main.py.
5. TASK 4: Write a test for the Module.

<br>

The module can be as simple as 

```Python
def greet(name):
  return 'hello {}'.format(name)
```

but should be sored in a file in a folder.

---
### A better mergetool
<br>

Meld: http://meldmerge.org/

```bat
git config --global merge.tool meld
git config --global diff.tool meld
git config --global mergetool.meld.path "C:\Program Files (x86)\Meld\meld.exe"
```
